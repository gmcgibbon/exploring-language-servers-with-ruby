            # Exploring Language Servers with Ruby

            #### [Gannon McGibbon](https://gannon.io/)

            Note:
            For Winnipeg Ruby User Group, February 2024
            ---
            ## 👋 Hi, I'm Gannon

            ![Gannon](images/me.jpg)

            - Works at Shopify
            - Committer on Ruby on Rails
            - Organizes Winnipeg Ruby
            Note:
            - Intro
            ---
            ## My first programming language

            ![Visual Basic 6.0](images/vb6.png)

            Note:
            - VB6 was light on code
            - Form builder
            - Event based scripting
            - It was a good intro to programming
            ---
            ## IntelliSense!

            ![IntelliSense in VB6](images/intellisense.jpg)

            Note:
            - Had IntelliSense
            - Hints for objects
            - Code completion way back in 1998
            ---
            ## Moved onto BlueJ

            ![BlueJ](images/bluej.jpg)

            Note:
            - Moved onto Java and BlueJ
            - Had no code completion at all
            - Told it was programming for "grown ups"
            - Learned a lot about OO
            - Might be why I dislike Java
            ---
            ## Fast forward to VSCode

            ![Visual Studio Code](images/vscode.png)

            Note:
            - I use VSCode today
            - Built for TypeScript first
            - Didn't always work well with Ruby
            ---
            ## IntelliSense?

            ![IntelliSense in TypeScript](images/intellisense-vscode.png)

            Note:
            - Shipped with IntelliSense, but only in JS/TS
            - Other languages weren't well supported
            - Why not Ruby?
            ---
            ## Why not Ruby?

            - Microsoft isn't using Ruby
            - Ruby is dynamic and complicated
            - Simply not "possible"

            Note:
            - Microsoft doesn't like Ruby
            - Ruby is too complicated
            - Simply impossible
            ---
            # Language Servers to the rescue!

            Note:
            - Not anymore!
            - Let's talk about language servers
            ---
            ## The Language Server Protocol (LSP)

            ![Python LSP](images/lsp-example-python.jpg)

            Note:
            - Built by Microsoft for VSCode, open sourced in 2016
            - Provides interface for code editor features
            - Don't have to use VSCode
            - Evolving standard
            ---
            ## How Language Servers work

            ```mermaid
            flowchart LR
              Developer("👨‍💻")
              Editor -- "Request" --> Server
              Server -- "Response" --> Editor
              Developer -- "Interacts" --> Editor
            ```

            Note:
            - How it works
            - Explain the diagram
            ---
            ## How the LSP works

            ```mermaid
            sequenceDiagram
              👨‍💻 ->> Editor: Edits some code
              Editor -->> Server: Request: textDocument/completion
              Server -->> Editor: Response: CompletionItem[]
            ```

            Note:
            - Zooming into the feedback loop
            - Explain diagram
            - JSON-RPC requests and responses
            - Sent via STDIN and STDOUT
            ---
            ## Working with multiple Servers

            ```mermaid
            sequenceDiagram
              👨‍💻 ->> Editor: Edits Ruby file
              Editor -->> Ruby Server: Request: textDocument/completion
              Ruby Server -->> Editor: Response: CompletionItem[]
              👨‍💻 ->> Editor: Edits TypeScript file
              Editor -->> TypeScript Server: Request: textDocument/signatureHelp
              TypeScript Server -->> Editor: Response: SignatureHelp
            ```

            Note:
            - You aren't bound to one server
            - Could have several for a complex project
            - Could even have multiple for the same language
            ---
            ## Supported Languages

            ![Supported Languages](images/supported-languages.jpg)

            Note:
            - Here's a list of implementations
            - Language servers for languages and frameworks
            - The list is growing
            ---
            ## What is Language Server Indexing Format (LSIF)?

            - Indexing format for dumping info on code
            - Extended from LSP format
            - Provides rich editor features remotely

            Note:
            - LSIF is a sister technology to LSP
            - Used to dump knowledge on a static codebase
            - Allows us to get rich editor features without cloning
            ---
            ## Example of LSIF

            ![GitLab Code Intelligence](images/code-intelligence.jpg)
            ![GitLab Code Intelligence Example](images/code-intelligence-example.png)

            Note:
            - Isn't helpful without an example
            - GitLab uses LSIF for Code Intelligence
            - GitHub uses a proprietary indexing tool
            ---
            # How do we get IntelliSense in Ruby?

            Note:
            - We now know what language servers are
            - Let's use them to get IntelliSense in Ruby
            ---
            ## Ruby LSP

            ![Ruby LSP](images/ruby-lsp.jpg)

            Note:
            - First, Ruby-LSP
            - Built by Shopify
            - Adds several features to Ruby development
            - Let's talk about a few of them
            ---
            ## Symbol search

            ![Document Symbol](images/document-symbol.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/documentSymbol` requests
            - `Cmd+P`, type `@`
            - Allows us to jump to parsed tokens in a file
            ---
            ## Source links

            ![Document Link](images/document-link.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/documentLink` requests
            - Makes links to gem source in docs clickable
            ---
            ## Constant info on hover

            ![Hover](images/hover.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/hover` requests
            - Shows documentation and source location for constants when hovering
            - Note if a constant has multiple source locations, they are included
            ---
            ## Linting

            ![Formatting](images/formatting.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/formatting` requests
            - Makes the editor lint on save with Rubocop
            - Rubocop is the de-facto code linting tool for Ruby
            ---
            ## Test and debug code lenses

            ![Code Lens](images/code-lens.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/codeLens` requests
            - Gives us clickable links to run and debug tests
            - Keyed to minitest, there's an extension gem for RSpec
            ---
            ## Signature help for local methods

            ![Signature Help](images/signature-help.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/signatureHelp` requests
            - Gives us a signature info as we type a method call
            - Only supports methods on the current object
            ---
            ## Constant autocompletion

            ![Completion](images/completion.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/completion` requests
            - Gives us suggestions for require paths and constants as we type
            - Doesn't provide method suggestions
            ---
            # How does it work?

            Note:
            - That's great, but how does it work?
            ---
            ## The Handshake

            - Developer enables extension for the LSP
            - Editor sends an initialization request
            - Server responds with capabilities of what it can do
            - Editor sends supported requests for a given language

            Note:
            - Developer installs an LSP extension
            - Editor boots the server
            - Editor sends init request and gets capabilities back
            - Editor knows what server can do now
            ---
            ## The Handshake

            ```mermaid
            sequenceDiagram
              👨‍💻 ->> Editor: Activates extension
              Editor -->> Server: Starts
              Server -->> Editor: Ready
              Editor -->> Server: Request: initialize
              Server -->> Editor: Response: InitializeResult
              👨‍💻 ->> Editor: Edits code
              Editor -->> Server: Request: textDocument/completion
              Server -->> Editor: Response: CompletionItems[]
            ```

            Note:
            - Looks like this
            - Explain diagram
            ---
            ## A Note on Implementation

            - Server must understand its supported language
            - Server doesn't have to be implemented in it
            - The Ruby LSP uses Prism to parse Ruby

            Note:
            - Server must understand the language it is written for
            - Server doesn't have to be implemented in said language
            - The Ruby LSP is implemented in Ruby and Prism
            - Could also have a Ruby Server written in Rust
            ---
            ## Prism

            ![Prism](images/prism.png)

            Note:
            - Ruby parser
            - Breaks code down into an AST
            - AST is a representation of code as objects
            - Other static analysis gems do this (parser)
            ---
            ## Ruby LSP and Syntax Trees

            ![Show Syntax Tree](images/show-syntax-tree.gif)

            Note:
            - Ruby LSP has a feature to show the raw AST
            - This is how it reads and understand Ruby code
            - Let's look at this closer
            ---
            ## Syntax Tree

            ```rb[]
            class Foo
            end
            ```

            ```txt[]
            @ ProgramNode (location: (4,0)-(5,3))
            ├── locals: []
            └── statements:
                @ StatementsNode (location: (4,0)-(5,3))
                └── body: (length: 1)
                    └── @ ClassNode (location: (4,0)-(5,3))
                        ├── locals: []
                        ├── class_keyword_loc: (4,0)-(4,5) = "class"
                        ├── constant_path:
                        │   @ ConstantReadNode (location: (4,6)-(4,9))
                        │   └── name: :Foo
                        ├── inheritance_operator_loc: ∅
                        ├── superclass: ∅
                        ├── body: ∅
                        ├── end_keyword_loc: (5,0)-(5,3) = "end"
                        └── name: :Foo
            ```
            Note:
            - The AST from the last slide
            - All of this represents an empty class
            ---
            ## Syntax Tree

            ```rb[3-4]
            class Foo
            end
            ```

            ```txt[6,8-11,14-16]
            @ ProgramNode (location: (1,0)-(2,3))
            ├── locals: []
            └── statements:
                @ StatementsNode (location: (1,0)-(2,3))
                └── body: (length: 1)
                    └── @ ClassNode (location: (1,0)-(2,3))
                        ├── locals: []
                        ├── class_keyword_loc: (1,0)-(1,5) = "class"
                        ├── constant_path:
                        │   @ ConstantReadNode (location: (1,6)-(1,9))
                        │   └── name: :Foo
                        ├── inheritance_operator_loc: ∅

                        ├── body: ∅
                        ├── end_keyword_loc: (2,0)-(2,3) = "end"
                        └── name: :Foo
            ```
            Note:
            - Explain the code
            ---
            ## Language Server SDK Gem

            ![Language Server Protocol](images/language-server-protocol.jpg)

            Note:
            - Ruby LSP uses an SDK gem to do the hard parts
            - Provides APIs to setup a language server in Ruby
            ---
            ## Language Server SDK List

            ![Language Server Implementations](images/implementations.png)

            Note:
            - There's a list of implementation libraries
            - The Ruby SDK isn't on this list
            - I'm sure there's more than this
            ---
            ## Source Links

            ![Document Symbol](images/document-link.gif)

            Note:
            - We know how its built
            - We need an example
            - Let's step back to source links
            ---
            ## Executor

            ```rb[]
            class RubyLsp::Executor
              def run(request)
                uri = URI(request.dig(:params, :textDocument, :uri).to_s)
                case request[:method]
                when "textDocument/documentLink"
                  document = @store.get(uri)
                  dispatcher = Prism::Dispatcher.new
                  document_link = Requests::DocumentLink.new(uri, document.comments, dispatcher)

                  document_link.perform
                end
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - The executor object accepts the request
            - A big case statement routes the request
            - When recognized, a request object is performed
            ---
            ## Executor

            ```rb[2,4,5,7-8,10-12]
            class RubyLsp::Executor
              def run(request)
                uri = URI(request.dig(:params, :textDocument, :uri).to_s)
                case request[:method]
                when "textDocument/documentLink"
                  document = @store.get(uri)
                  dispatcher = Prism::Dispatcher.new
                  document_link = Requests::DocumentLink.new(uri, document.comments, dispatcher)
                  dispatcher.dispatch(document.tree)
                  document_link.perform
                end
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Explain each part
            ---
            ## Request

            ```rb[]
            class RubyLsp::Requests::DocumentLink < Request
              def self.provider
                Interface::DocumentLinkOptions.new(resolve_provider: false)
              end

              def initialize(uri, comments, dispatcher)
                super()
                @listener = Listeners::DocumentLink.new(uri, comments, dispatcher)
                # ...
              end
        
              def perform
                @listener.response
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - This is the document link request class
            - It defines the provider and the listener
            - We're interested in the listener
            ---
            ## Request

            ```rb[6,8,10,12-14]

                Interface::DocumentLinkOptions.new(resolve_provider: false)
              end

              def initialize(uri, comments, dispatcher)
                super()
                @listener = Listeners::DocumentLink.new(uri, comments, dispatcher)

                @listener.response
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Explain the code
            ---
            ## Listener

            ```rb[]
            class RubyLsp::Listeners::DocumentLink < Listener
              def initialize(uri, comments, dispatcher)
                super(dispatcher)
                dispatcher.register(
                  self,
                  :on_def_node_enter,
                  :on_class_node_enter,
                  :on_module_node_enter,

              def on_def_node_enter(node)
                extract_document_link(node)
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - This is the listener for document links
            - Uses prism to listen for parsing events
            - We extract documented links for each kind of node
            ---
            ## Listener

                match = comment.location.slice.match(%r{source://.*#\d+$})
                uri = URI(match[0])
                gem_version = resolve_version(uri)

                )
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - This is the extract document link method
            - Basically we find links from docs and add them to the response
            ---
            ## Listener

            ```rb[3-13]
            class RubyLsp::Listeners::DocumentLink < Listener
              def extract_document_link(node)

            Note:
            - Explain the code
            ---
            ## Source Links

            ![Document Symbol](images/document-link.gif)

            Note:
            - Put it all together
            ---
            ## What about Rails?

            ![Ruby LSP Rails](images/ruby-lsp-rails.jpg)

            Note:
            - There's a gem for that
            - Extends Ruby LSP to understand Rails
            ---
            ## Installation

            ```rb
            # Gemfile

            gem "ruby-lsp-rails", group: :development
            ```
            ```sh
            > bundle install
            ```

            Note:
            - We add it to our bundle
            - Run bundle install
            - This won't be needed in the future
            - Let's talk about some features
            ---
            ## Schema info on hover

            ![Rails Hover](images/rails-hover.gif)

            Note:
            - Powered by `textDocument/hover` requests
            - Shows column info and where it is defined for models
            - This info is decoupled from the model class by default
            ---
            ## Test and debug code lenses

            ![Code Lens](images/rails-code-lens.gif)

            Note:
            - Same as the test code lens in Ruby LSP
            - Uses the Rails test runner
            ---
            # Missing pieces

            Note:
            - We don't have full code completion
            - Only for constants, local signatures
            - We can do better
            ---
            ## Sorbet

            ![Sorbet](images/sorbet.png)

            Note:
            - To get more features, we need static typing
            - Sorbet allows us to add typing to Ruby
            - Sorbet is a talk within itself, I'll be brief
            ---
            ## Installation

            ```rb
            # Gemfile

            gem "sorbet", require: false
            gem "sorbet-runtime"
            gem "tapioca", require: false
            ```
            ```sh
            > bundle install
            ```

            Note:
            - We add sorbet gems to our bundle
            - Allows us to use static and runtime typing info
            - Run bundle install
            ---
            ## Installation

            ```sh
            > bundle exec tapioca init
            ```
            ```sh
            sorbet
            ├── config
            ├── rbi
            │   ├── annotations
            │   │   ├── *.rbi
            │   ├── gems
            │   │   ├── *.rbi
            │   └── todo.rbi
            └── tapioca
                ├── config.yml
                └── require.rb
            ```

            Note:
            - We can initialize Sorbet with Tapioca
            - Tapioca generates interface files (RBIs)
            - We'll use these files later
            ---
            ## Installation
            ```rb[1]
            # typed: true
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
            end
            ```
            ```rb[1]
            # typed: true
            # frozen_string_literal: true
            
            class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
            end
            ```
            ```rb[1]
            # typed: true
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            module ApplicationHelper
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Sorbet denotes typing with comments
            - This is helpful for projects adopting typing
            - Need to set all files to typed: true
            ---
            ## Signatures

            ```rb
            # typed: true
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            class Greeting
              extend T::Sig

              sig { void }
              def hello
                puts "Hello Sorbet"
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Explain the code
            ---

            ## Signatures
            ```rb[1,5,7]
            # typed: true
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            class Greeting
              extend T::Sig

              sig { void }
              def hello
                puts "Hello Sorbet"
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - You'll see this in the next slides
            - We don't need to add sigs to code
            - Ships with type defs for standard library
            ---
            ## Sorbet LSP

            ![Sorbet LSP](images/sorbet-lsp.png)

            Note:
            - With sorbet in place, we can use the Sorbet LSP
            - This will give us fill the support gaps Ruby LSP has
            - Written in C, understands Ruby
            - Let's talk about features
            ---
            ## Type Errors

            ![Type Errors](images/sorbet-type-errors.png)

            Note:
            - First, inline typing info
            - Shows typing errors in the editor
            - We're not really interested in this feature
            ---
            ## Method Info on Hover

            ![Sorbet Hover](images/sorbet-hover.png)

            Note:
            - Shows method docs and typing info on hover
            - Allows us to quickly peek at method information
            - Works with standard library methods and application code
            ---
            ## Go To Definition

            <video id="sorbet-definition" data-autoplay loop src="images/sorbet-definition.mp4"></video>

            Note:
            - Jumps to the source location of something on right click
            - Works with gem and application files
            - `Cmd+Click` also works
            ---
            ## Autocomplete

            <video data-autoplay loop src="images/sorbet-autocomplete.mp4"></video>

            Note:
            - Gives us method autocompletion as we type
            - Write code faster, remember less
            - Works with standard library methods and application code
            ---
            ## We have IntelliSense in Ruby!

            # 🥳

            Note:
            - We have IntelliSense
            ---
            ## Ruby Extension Pack

            ![Ruby Extension Pack](images/ruby-extension-pack.png)

            Note:
            - Shopify has an extension pack with these extensions
            - Sorbet is only used if you have it on your project
            - It includes an additional debug extension not covered
            ---
            ## Summary

            - Use Language Servers!
            - You can use multiple Language Servers
            - Help make Language Servers better!

            Note:
            - Use language servers if you aren't already
            - Can use multiple servers, per language or framework
            - Language Servers are new, help out
